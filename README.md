## PCT Example

The problem description can be find [here](./problem.pdf).

*NOTE: this program is wrote under JDK1.8, if you use other JDK version, I cannot sure it worked for you. *

The main program is in file `example.ProblemSolution.java` under directory `src/`.

Now `displayProblem1Solution()` method is commented, if you want to test problem1 please **uncomment** it.

You can run `displayProblem1Solution()` and `displayProblem2Solution()` at the same time to test both two problems.

If you have time, please generate more test files to test the program. **If you find any bug, please let me know !!!**

Thank you

# PctExample

The main program is in file `ProblemSolution.java` under directory `src/`. 

Now `displayProblem1Solution()` method is commented, if you want to test problem1 please **uncomment** it.q

You can run `displayProblem1Solution()` and `displayProblem2Solution()` at the same time to test both two problems.

If you have time, please generate more test files to test the program. **If you find some bug, please let me know !!!**

Thankyou
